                <figcaption>The Offside Rule: It is not an offence to be in an offside position.
                    A player is in an offside position if: any part of the head, body or feet is in the opponents' half
                    (excluding the halfway line) and any part of the head, body or feet is nearer to the opponents' goal line than
                    both the ball and the second-last opponent.
