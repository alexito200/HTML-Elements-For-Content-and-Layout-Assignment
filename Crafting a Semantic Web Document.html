                Pickleball was born in 1965. After playing golf during the summer, Joel Pritchard, a congressman from Washington, and Bill Bell,
                a successful businessman, returned to Pritchard&#39;s home on Bainbridge Island, not far from Seattle, Washington. With bored children
                at home, they sought to play badminton on an old badminton court but couldn&#39;t find the proper equipment. They improvised and played
                with table tennis paddles and a perforated plastic ball. They began with the net at a badminton net height (60 inches high) and 
                volleyed the ball back and forth over the net. Eventually as play progressed during the weekend, they found the ball bounced well
                on the asphalt surface and they would eventually lower the net to 36 inches high. The following weekend, Barney McCallum joined and
                began playing and the three men created the rules for pickleball. The men remembered the original purpose of creating the game was
                for a game the whole family could play when they were bored.
